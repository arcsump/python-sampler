This is a Nokia Maps fetcher (with customizable zoom levels, map width, map height, etc) for all countries and cities in the world. It utilizes also the Google's Geocoding API to retrieve the Latitude and Longitude values of a place. We actually used this script in our custom development in <a href="http://travel.cnn.com">CNN Travel</a> site.
